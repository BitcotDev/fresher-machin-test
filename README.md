# React Coding Challenge

> Welcome to the React Coding Challenge!

## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens.

## The Challenge

Using the provided screens as a reference, you'll need to build a set of React components to render the app. You'll also need to request a [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitcotDev/fresher-machin-test/main/json/sample.json) feed, filter that data, and use the relevant fields.

Although this is a basic exercise, we'll be looking for **simple, performant, and tested code** in the submission.

## Details

Click [here](https://github.com/BitcotDev/fresher-machin-test/tree/main/screens/) to look Screens.

**Note:** Do not focus on the design of given screens its a reference.

You will need to build the following 5 screens with React:
- "Contacts View" screen
- "Add Contact" screen

- Fetch the Contact list from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitcotDev/fresher-machin-test/main/json/sample.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitcotDev/fresher-machin-test/main/json/sample.json)
- Display Contact list

- When I write any this thing in the search field it should be search by first name, last name and phone number.


## Other Notes

- It is important you follow good programing practices, clean code, good logic with proper comments, naming conventions.
- Write as many functions you require, you must focus on code reusability and avoid repetition of code.

- Create a public git repository on Github
- Repositry name should be your name-bitcot and push code.
- Do not include dependency folder like node_module.
